# Customer_Churn
Build a classification model to predict the current customer's churn probability.

Customer Churn Prediction for Retail Stores
This is a beginner-level data analysis project focused on predicting customer churn in retail stores. The goal is to build a classification model to identify which customers are likely to leave, helping businesses take action in advance.


## Tools Used:
-Jupyter Notebook

-Python

-numpy

-scikit-learn

## Project Overview:
-Data cleaning and preprocessing

-Feature engineering (selecting variables that affect churn)

-Building classification models (such as logistic regression and decision trees)

-Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

-Business insights and suggestions

## Project Files:
-customer_churn.ipynb: Main analysis notebook

-data/: Contains customer data (or simulated data)

-images/: Charts and visualizations
